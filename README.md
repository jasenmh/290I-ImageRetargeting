290I-ImageRetargeting
=====================

This repository is for the Image/Video Retargeting with Seam Carving project for Matt Turk's
CS290I Computer Imaging class at UC Santa Barbara.

This repo was poorly maintained. A more complete version of this algorithm, including a variety of parallel implementations using Cilk Plus, can be found at https://github.com/jasenmh/CS240A-VideoRetargeting.

- [X] Decide on implementation language: Matlab (+OpenCV possible)
- [X] Decide on specific algorithm: Seam carving using gradient mapping
- [X] Implement on 2D images
- [X] Implement on video
- [ ] Test
